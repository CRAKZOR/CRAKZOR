  - Designing and implementing a new programming language using LLVM (HackUTA).
  - A 3D graphics web app tool for Knell Graphics called "Knell Graphics Educational Aid" (senior design project at UTA).
  - An AIO dealership, inventory, and customer management system for Five Stone Investments LLC (work project).

- ðŸ“« Reach me at: me@njrb.dev
  
- âš¡ Fun fact: When not diving deep into code, I'm either engrossed in anime, flipping through manga pages, battling it out on my PC, or hitting the pavement for a refreshing run.
